# Meetup format

GoGraz (similar to PyGraz) should focus on two main elements:

1. presentations by the community for the community
2. coding dojos in order to collectively learn and improve our
   practical knowledge of the language and/or libraries
   

## Presentations

We should try to organize one presentation (20-30min) each month
followed by basically an open slot for lightning talks (5-10min).

Full presentations should be announced at least 1 week before the
meetup takes place. The person who wants to give a talk should create
a ticket in our planning issue tracker with a short description of
what their talk will be all about. Scheduling will then take place
inside that ticket.

Lightning talks require no announcement. If someone wants to present
something, they should just do so.


## Coding dojos

Additionally, we should try to organize one coding dojo per quarter
where everyone is working together on one laptop to solve a specific
coding problem. The topic itself doesn't need to be announced prior to
the event but the result should be published on Github.
